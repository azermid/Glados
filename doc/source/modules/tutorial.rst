Your first program
==================

This section contains a tutorial on how to write code using the MultipleLanguageLanguage.

To write your first program, you need to create a file with the `.mll` extension.
Then you have to set an entry point for your program by creating a function called `main`.

Example
-------

.. code-block:: c

    int main() {
        // code to execute
    }
