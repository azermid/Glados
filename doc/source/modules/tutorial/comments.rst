Comments
########

Comments are lines in the code that are ignored during the execution of the code. Comments can be single-line or multi-line.

Single-line comments
====================

Single-line comments start with `//` and end at the end of the line.

Example
-------

.. code-block:: c

    // This is a single-line comment

    int i = 0; // This is a single-line comment

Multi-line comments
===================

Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`. Multi-line comments can span multiple lines.

Example
-------

.. code-block:: c

    /* This is a multi-line comment
    that spans multiple lines */

    int i = 0; /* This is a multi-line comment
    that spans multiple lines */
